   - Under 200KB each for performance

3. **Update Meta Tags**
   Add to your homepage (`/src/pages/index.js`):

   <Head>
     <title>Fabián Miranda | Full-Stack Developer & Digital Transformation Expert | Costa Rica</title>
     <meta name="description" content="Transform your business with expert full-stack development, CLM solutions, and AI consulting. 15+ years delivering results for Fortune 500s and startups. Get a free consultation." />
   </Head>
   ```

### Content Creation Priorities:

   - Set up lead magnet (CLM Implementation Checklist)

2. **Week 2**
   - Write first blog posts focusing on CLM and digital production
   - Add schema markup for better SEO
   - Create AI Readiness Assessment tool

3. **Week 3**
   - Launch email newsletter

   - Implement chat/WhatsApp integration

### Performance Monitoring:

Set up tracking for:
- Page load times (target < 2 seconds)
- Conversion rate on CTA buttons
- Time spent on Work Samples section
- Click-through rates to project pages

## Questions to Consider:

1. Do you have client testimonials we can add to each project?
2. Can we get permission to share more specific metrics from clients?
3. Do you have additional projects to showcase?
4. Would you like to add filtering by technology or industry?

## Technical Notes:

- The component uses Next.js Image component for optimization
- Hover effects use CSS transitions for smooth animations
- Mobile-first responsive design maintained
- Accessibility: Added aria-labels to links
