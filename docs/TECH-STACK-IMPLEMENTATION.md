# Tech Stack Implementation - Multiple Views

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

We've created TWO stunning tech stack visualizations:

### 1. **Interactive Filter Grid** 
- Clean, professional grid layout
- Filterable by category with counts
- Smooth animations
- Best for quick scanning

### 2. **True Honeycomb Grid** (Fixed & Improved!)
- **Proper hexagonal honeycomb pattern**
- Clean, non-overlapping hexagons
- Dramatic hover effects (scale, rotate, glow)
- Category badges on first item of each group
- Floating background pattern for depth

## Honeycomb Features:

### Visual Design:
- **True hexagonal shapes** using SVG polygons
- **Proper honeycomb positioning** with offset rows
- **Hover effects**: 
  - Scale up to 1.3x
  - Lift up with translateY
  - Slight rotation for dynamism
  - Glowing border in category color
  - Drop shadow effect
- **Tech name appears on hover** in colored badge above hexagon
- **Category labels** for visual grouping

### Responsive Design:
- **Desktop**: 110px hexagons with proper spacing
- **Tablet**: 80px hexagons, adjusted spacing
- **Mobile**: 55px hexagons, compact layout

### Categories & Colors:
- **Frontend**: Electric Blue (#00D4FF)
- **Frameworks**: Neon Purple (#9945FF)  
- **CMS**: Success Green (#00FFA3)
- **Hosting & Tools**: Warning Orange (#FF6B35) / Gray

## Toggle Feature:
Beautiful toggle buttons let users switch between:
- **Grid View**: For professional, scannable layout
- **Honeycomb View**: For visual impact and memorability

## To Run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `/about` → "Current Focus" section → Try both views!

## Why This Honeycomb Works:
- **Clean geometry**: No overlapping, proper honeycomb pattern
- **Visual hierarchy**: Category badges help organize
- **Memorable**: Unique layout that stands out
- **Interactive**: Engaging hover effects
- **Professional**: Still maintains sophisticated aesthetic

The honeycomb view is perfect for portfolios and presentations where you want to make a strong visual impression while showcasing your technical expertise!
