# Honeycomb Glow Fix - Summary

## Problem
The hover glow effects on the honeycomb hexagons were being cut off/clipped by container boundaries.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Increased Container Sizes**
- Main container: `min-height: 650px` (was 600px)
- Grid width: `750px` (was 700px) 
- Grid height: `550px` (was 500px)
- Added extra padding: `4rem` on honeycomb grid

### 2. **Ensured Overflow Visible**
- Added `overflow: visible` to all parent containers:
  - `.honeycombContainer`
  - `.honeycombGrid`
  - `.focus-section`
  - `.focus-section .container`
  - `.focus-image` (already had it)
  - `.content` in toggle (already had it)

### 3. **Adjusted Glow Effects**
- Optimized drop-shadow values for better performance:
  - Main shadow: `0 20px 40px rgba(0, 212, 255, 0.4)`
  - Secondary shadow: `0 10px 20px var(--hex-color)`
  - Polygon glow: `0 0 20px var(--hex-color)`

### 4. **Added Min-Width to Focus Image**
- Set `min-width: 800px` on `.focus-image` for desktop
- Ensures the container is wide enough for the honeycomb
- Removes min-width on tablets and below

### 5. **Responsive Adjustments**
- Increased mobile container sizes slightly for better glow space
- Maintained proper scaling ratios

## Result
The honeycomb hexagons now have proper space to display their full hover effects including:
- Scale transformation (1.3x)
- Elevation (-15px translateY)
- Rotation (5deg)
- Full glow/shadow effects without clipping

The glow effects now properly extend beyond the hexagon boundaries creating a premium, polished interaction!
