  ## Executive Summary


  Contabilidad Costa Rica required a comprehensive digital transformation to compete in an increasingly online marketplace. Through the implementation of Next.js Static Site Generation (SSG) architecture combined with a strategic SEO and social media content marketing campaign, we delivered a lightning-fast platform that achieved excellent Lighthouse scores (90+) and #1 search rankings for competitive keywords. The result: 150% increase in qualified leads and 40% market capture of online accounting inquiries in the region.


  ## Client Background


  Contabilidad Costa Rica specializes in providing accounting, tax consulting, and compliance services for SMEs, expats, and international businesses operating in Costa Rica.

  ## Key Takeaways


  This project demonstrates how combining modern web technology (SSG architecture) with strategic content marketing (SEO + social media) transforms traditional professional services businesses into digital leaders.


  The Next.js SSG architecture created the perfect foundation for both technical SEO excellence (pre-rendered HTML easily crawled and indexed) and exceptional user experience (SPA-like navigation after hydration). This dual benefit - fast for crawlers, smooth for users - enabled content to rank higher while converting visitors more effectively than competitors using traditional CMS platforms.


  The integrated social media strategy proved that authority building and search rankings reinforce each other. Regular LinkedIn and Facebook posting drove branded searches, increased backlinks, and built trust before prospects visited the website. This social credibility loop accelerated SEO performance beyond what on-page optimization alone could achieve.


  Most importantly, the 150% increase in qualified leads validates that technical performance directly impacts business results. When page loads drop from 4.2s to <0.8s and Lighthouse scores improve to 90+, bounce rates decrease and conversions increase. When educational content ranks #1 for high-intent keywords, qualified prospects find you exactly when they're ready to hire an accountant.
